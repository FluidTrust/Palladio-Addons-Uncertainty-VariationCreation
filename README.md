# Palladio-Addons-Uncertainty-VariationCreation

## Introduction
This project extends the Palladio Component Model as well as the models of the Fluid Trust Project with the functionality to automatically generate parallely existing variants from these basis models. This 
generation is controlled through the Uncertainty Variation Model and the state handlers. The Uncertainty Variation Model contains the variation points that affect the source models with their possible values. The state handlers realisize the transformation of the source models to the different variants based on the Uncertainty Variation Models description.
